    "While regex works great for structured data, AI excels at:\n",
    "- **Understanding context**: Distinguishing between different types of experience\n",
    "- **Handling variations**: Different ways people describe skills\n",
    "- **Semantic understanding**: Knowing that \"Python\" in skills context means programming\n",
    "- **Extracting relationships**: Connecting job titles with companies and dates\n",

    "#### LangChain + OpenAI Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prompt Engineering**: Create specific prompts for each type of information\n",
    "2. **Chain Operations**: Use LangChain to structure our AI calls\n",
    "3. **Output Parsing**: Convert AI responses into structured data\n",
    "4. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle API failures\n",
